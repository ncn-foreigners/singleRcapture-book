# Single-source Capture-Recapture Models Using R

This repository contains the source code and materials for the book *Single-source Capture-Recapture Models Using R*. The book covers methods and techniques in statistical modeling, with a focus on capture-recapture models.


### Project Description:
This book explores single-source capture-recapture models, which are used to estimate the size of populations where individuals are captured, marked, and then recaptured after a period. This method is essential for ecological studies, public health applications, and social sciences. The book provides practical examples and code using R, including methods such as Poisson models, negative binomial regression, and doubly robust estimation.

The book is centered around the **singleRcapture** R package, which was developed by the authors for the applications discussed in the book. This package provides functions and tools for implementing capture-recapture models and analyzing related data.
